DEATHBUCKET

DEATHBUCKET makes it easy for users to build a bucket list of their choice while having a calculation of their time left on planet earth. While we know the concept of death is not a very friendly one, this will make our users conscious about the value of time. After the time spent at work, groceries, caring for others, etc, we only have so much time left available for us: real life me-time! According to our data, the average American lives 80 years old only 10% of that time is reserved to do as we please.

Our inspiration came from this video on YouTube. However, we changed the data to reflect the situation in the US.

Development Process

As a group, we started brainstorming and later decided on what kind of app this would be, and the data plus reach goals we wanted to display. We used tools such as Jira and Google Hangouts to be in touch during the weekend.

The API took most of our time, but we worked on the front end along the way. For styling we dedicated the last day before presentation, but we wished we had more time to accomplish the design in mind. The main goal for us was to get the app working and running.
